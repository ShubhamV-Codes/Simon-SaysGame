# Simon-Says-Game : 

# 🟢 Simon Says Game

A fun and interactive **memory game** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player must replicate an increasingly complex sequence of button presses displayed by the game — just like the classic **Simon Says** game.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game randomly flashes a colored pattern (starting with one).
2. The player must click the buttons in the exact same order.
3. With each correct round, the sequence gets longer by one.
4. One wrong move ends the game — try to beat your high score!
